DEPSO
========

DEPSO, or called DEPS, is an algorithm for solving (constrained) numerical optimization problem (NOP), by hybridizing the advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE).

- Current version: The mini Series V1.00.03 (Java) with the DEPSO implementation
